### Database Technology
## Functional dependencies and Normalization

  * *Data:* known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning.
  * *Database:* collection of related data (logically corherent). Represents some aspects of the real world. Built for a specific purpose.


### Problems that database approach adress

  * redundancy: multiple copies
  * inconsistency: independent updates
  * inaccuracy: concurrent updates
  * incompability: multiple formats
  * insecurity: proliferation
  * inaduditability: poor chain of responsibility
  * inflexibilty: changes are difficult to apply

### Defining a Database

  * Specifying the datatypes, structures and constraints of the data to be stored.
  * *meta-data* database definition or descriptive information

### Phases for designing a DB

  * *conceptual design* - using the entity-relationship model
  * *logical desgin* - using the relation model
  * *physical design*

#### An Example

  * data records
    + Film
    + Person
    + Role
    + Honors


### Characteristics of the DB Approach

  * programs isloated from data through *abstraction*
  * datasharing through multiple *views*
  * multiuser *transaction* processing
  * data is *self-defining* (meta-data)

### Summary
Defined database as a collection of related data, where data means recorded facts. A typical database represents some aspect of the real world and is used for specific purpose by one or mpre groups of users.
